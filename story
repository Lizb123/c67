The rabbit sat pulling up bits of sweet summer grass. It was a plain rabbit, the same grey-brown of all wild rabbits. 
Christopher walked over to it, expecting it to dart away, but it didn't. 
He could tell as it turned to run that he should follow, so he did. The rabbit moved with great purpose down a stone path. The rabbit stopped in front of a vivid wildflower, 
nosing an orange butterfly on top. Looking closely, the boy saw it had a woman's face with perfectly coifed blond hair and tiny tears streaking her cheeks. One of her wings was 
bent. He gathered healing herbs from the forest floor and carefully set the break. Soon she flew off, good as new.

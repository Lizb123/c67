*story
The rabbit sat pulling up bits of sweet summer grass. It was a plain rabbit, the same grey-brown of all wild rabbits. 
Christopher walked over to it, expecting it to dart away, but it didn't. 
He could tell as it turned to run that he should follow, so he did. The rabbit moved with great purpose down a stone path. The rabbit stopped in front of a vivid wildflower, 
nosing an orange butterfly on top. Looking closely, the boy saw it had a woman's face with perfectly coifed blond hair and tiny tears streaking her cheeks. One of her wings was 
bent. He gathered healing herbs from the forest floor and carefully set the break. Soon she flew off, good as new. 


Christopher never knew when the rabbit would come, but he always followed. Once to a snail the size of a large beach-ball who wore a tiny top-hat and an 
impeccably round pair of spectacles. Except for the large crack in his shell, he looked quite dapper. It took some time, but Christopher was able to fuse the wound.Next there 
was the green-scaled creature not much larger than a chicken, and when he moaned, fire came from his mouth creating a sooty ring in the grass. Christopher looked him over, 
avoiding the hot puffs of air, struggling to find the problem. The dragon's enormous mother paced nearby.
